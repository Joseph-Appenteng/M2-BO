          <h2>What to expect <br><span></span></h2>
          <p>The National Video Game Museum is a "must see" for anyone wanting to learn (and experience) more about the historical, social and cultural aspects of video games. The museum also allows visitors to experience tomorrow's game. Players young and old are welcome to play, explore, learn and share experiences online.</p>
          <h3>Onze Geschiedenis</h3><br><span></span> 
          <p>A garage in The Hague is where the adventure started in 2008 with two friends Hasan Tasdemir and Pascal Rappailles. The garage soon became too small and they moved to a warehouse in an industrial area. Unfortunately the shed is unheated and everything had to be moved to the empty Ministry of Agriculture in the middle of winter. When the building, too, had to be cleaned, the then-collection of 10 arcade video games was stored in an old classic car showroom along with some spare parts. Since there was no place to decorate, and no place to fiddle with cabinets, I found a suitable place. It was discovered in 2011 on the Cobaltstraat in the Zoetermeer. There, Hasan decided to rent the place with 4 friends and the adventure could develop into their own meeting place to practice their hobbies and relax through games.
